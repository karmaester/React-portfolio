      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ My name is Khristian, Iâ€™m a full-stack software developer, and I use JavaScript, React-Redux, and Ruby on Rails to create attractive and efficient web platforms as business solutions for all kinds of enterprises.\n\nMy career began as a translator and language teacher, I spent every day working with a variety of people from different cultures as I developed strong communication skills, also teaching them how to associate concepts from one language to another and the logic behind it.\n\nLooking for better and didactic ways of teaching my students, I encountered myself interested in solving problems through code, an industry where the abilities to learn, teach, relate well to people, and high work ethics are of much value.\n\nRecently I enrolled in Microverse, a remote software development school, where I practiced pair-programming in over 40 different projects, from UX design to APIs, with remote developers from all around the world.
